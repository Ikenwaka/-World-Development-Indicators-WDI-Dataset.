# -Life Expectancy, Income and Sources of Environmental Degradation in Nigeria.
Nigeria â€“the most populous country in Africa of about 200 million and an oil-dependent economy have shown a dangerously high level of environmental degradation from several sources. According to a recent publication, Nwaka et al (2020), economic expansion and their effects on environmental degradation have shown a consistent appearance in the several environmental issues. However, the intersection of life expectancy (average years an individual lives), income per capita and sources of environmental degradation have not been well explored. This project serves to explore descriptively this interconnectedness. Based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) initiatives of promoting decent environment, high standard of living and life expectancy, the following questions are raised: Does environmental degradation in Nigeria also translate to higher life expectancy? Does environmental degradation in Nigeria also translate to a higher level of income?
